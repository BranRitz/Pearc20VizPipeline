# Pearc2020 - VizPipeline1 - Helping parents protect their children from COVID-19

> This project was written for a Hackathon hosted by Science Gateways Community Institute to show parents the correlation between public schools and covid cases.


We used APIs to get data from the schools and from the covid reporting. The following APIs were used:
kaggle
arcgis.com

And the code uses plotly, dash, pandas to create a webpage that shows the following graphs:
